Welcome to day 1 of the Python Challenge! 

If you're here to learn Python,
you've come to the right place.

If you already have some Python experience, I
hope I can teach you at least a few new tricks, or throw you a few challenging
problems.

If you're here to learn how to use Python for machine learning, data
analysis, or visualization, then bad news: I won't be teaching any of that. Good
news: we have [several tracks on Kaggle
Learn](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview) for just that purpose. The goal of
this challenge is to quickly cover the fundamentals of the language - which will
hopefully stand you in good stead whether you use Python for deep learning, data
cleaning, or cheating at Scrabble.

Each day of the Python Challenge will
consist of two parts:
- A **tutorial** notebook explaining Python concepts and
showing example code. That's where you are now.
- An
[**exercise**](https://www.kaggle.com/kernels/fork/969424) notebook with
questions and coding problems to test your new knowledge.

Today's tutorial
includes a brief overview of Python syntax, variable assignment, and arithmetic
operators. If you have previous Python experience, day 1 might not hold anything
new for you, so feel free to [skip straight to the
exercise](https://www.kaggle.com/kernels/fork/969424).

# Hello, Python!

Python was named for the British comedy troupe [Monty
Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Python), so why not make our first
Python program an homage to their famous
[Spam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spam_(Monty_Python%29) skit?

<!-- todo:
maybe a little side note on spam metasyntactic variables in Python -->

Just for
fun, try reading over the code below and predicting what it's going to do when
run. (If you have no idea, that's fine!)

Then click the "output" button to see
the results of our program.

```python
spam_amount = 0
print(spam_amount)

# Ordering Spam, egg, Spam, Spam, bacon and Spam (4 more servings of Spam)
spam_amount = spam_amount + 4

if spam_amount > 0:
    print("But I don't want ANY spam!")

viking_song = "Spam " * spam_amount
print(viking_song)
```

There's a lot to unpack here! This silly program demonstrates many important
aspects of what Python code looks like (its *syntax*) and how it works (its
*semantics*). Let's run down the code from top to bottom.

```python
spam_amount = 0
```

**Variable assignment!** Here we create a variable called `spam_amount` and
assign it the value of 0 using `=`, Python's assignment operator.

> **Aside**:
If you've programmed in certain other languages (like Java or C++), you might be
noticing some things Python *doesn't* require us to do here:  
- we don't need
to "declare" `spam_amount` before assigning to it
- we don't need to tell Python
what type of value `spam_amount` is going to refer to. In fact, we can even go
on to reassign `spam_amount` to refer to a different sort of thing like a string
or a boolean.

```python
print(spam_amount)
```

A **function call**. `print` is an extremely useful builtin Python function that
displays the value passed to it on the screen. We call functions by putting
parentheses after their name, with the inputs to the function (or *arguments*)
in between.

```python
# Ordering Spam, egg, Spam, Spam, bacon and Spam (4 more servings of Spam)
spam_amount = spam_amount + 4
```

The first line above is a **comment**. In Python, comments begin with the `#`
symbol.

Next we see an example of reassignment. Reassigning the value of an
existing variable looks just the same as creating a variable - it still uses the
`=` assignment operator.

In this case, the value we're assigning to
`spam_amount` involves a little simple arithmetic on its previous value. When it
encounters this line, Python evaluates the expression on the right-hand-side of
the `=` (0 + 4 = 4), and then assigns that value to the variable on the left-
hand-side.

```python
if spam_amount > 0:
    print("But I don't want ANY spam!")
```

We won't talk much about conditionals until later, but, even if you've never
coded before, you can probably guess what this does. Python is prized for its
readability and the simplicity of its syntax (with some going as far as to call
it "executable pseudocode"). 

Note how we indicated which code belongs to the
`if`. `"But I don't want ANY spam!"` is only supposed to be printed if
`spam_amount` is positive. But the later code (like `print(viking_song)`) should
be executed no matter what. How do we (and Python) know that?

The colon (`:`)
at the end of the `if` line indicates that a new "code block" is coming up.
Subsequent lines which are **indented** (beginning with an extra 4 spaces) are
part of that code block. You may be familiar with other languages which use
`{`curly braces`}` to mark the beginning and end of code blocks. Python's use of
meaningful whitespace often is surprising to programmers who are accustomed to
other languages, but in practice it can lead to more consistent and readable
code than languages that do not enforce indentation of code blocks. 

The later
lines dealing with `viking_song` are not indented with an extra 4 spaces, so
they're not a part of the `if`'s code block. We'll see more examples of indented
code blocks later when we start defining functions and using loops.

This code
snippet is also our first sighting of a **string** in Python:

```python
"But I
don't want ANY spam!"
```

Strings can be marked either by double or single
quotation marks. (But because this particular string *contains* a single-quote
character, we might confuse Python by trying to surround it with single-quotes,
unless we're careful.)

```python
viking_song = "Spam " * spam_amount
print(viking_song)
```

The `*` operator can be used to multiply two numbers (`3 * 3` evaluates to 9),
but amusingly enough, we can also multiply a string by a number, to get a
version that's been repeated that many times. Python offers a number of cheeky
little time-saving tricks like this where operators like `*` and `+` have a
different meaning depending on what kind of thing they're applied to. (The
technical term for this is [operator
overloading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_overloading))

## Numbers and arithmetic in Python

We've already seen an example of a variable
containing a number above:

```python
spam_amount = 0
```

"Number" is a fine informal name for the kind of thing, but if we wanted to be
more technical, we could ask Python how it would describe the type of thing that
`spam_amount` is:

```python
type(spam_amount)
```

It's an `int` - short for integer. There's another sort of number we commonly
encounter in Python:

```python
type(19.95)
```

A `float` is a number with a decimal place - very useful for representing things
like weights or proportions.

`type()` is the second built-in function we've
seen (after `print()`), and it's another good one to remember. It's very useful
to be able to ask Python "what kind of thing is this?".

A natural thing to want to do with numbers is perform arithmetic. We've seen the
`+` operator for addition, and the `*` operator for multiplication (of a sort).
Python also has us covered for the rest of the basic buttons on your calculator:
| Operator     | Name           | Description
|
|--------------|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| ``a + b``    | Addition       | Sum of ``a`` and ``b``
|
| ``a - b``    | Subtraction    | Difference of ``a`` and ``b``
|
| ``a * b``    | Multiplication | Product of ``a`` and ``b``
|
| ``a / b``    | True division  | Quotient of ``a`` and ``b``
|
| ``a // b``   | Floor division | Quotient of ``a`` and ``b``, removing
fractional parts |
| ``a % b``    | Modulus        | Integer remainder after
division of ``a`` by ``b``     |
| ``a ** b``   | Exponentiation | ``a`` raised
to the power of ``b``                     |
| ``-a``       | Negation       |
The negative of ``a``                                  |

<span
style="display:none">hack</span>

One interesting observation here is that,
whereas your calculator probably just has one button for division, Python can do
two kinds. "True division" is basically what your calculator does:

```python
print(5 / 2)
print(6 / 2)
```

It always gives us a `float`. 

The `//` operator gives us a result that's
rounded down to the next integer.

```python
print(5 // 2)
print(6 // 2)
```

Can you think of where this would be useful? You may see an example soon in the
coding problems.

### Order of operations

The arithmetic we learned in primary school has
conventions about the order in which operations are evaluated. Some remember
these by a mnemonic such as **PEMDAS** - **P**arentheses, **E**xponents,
**M**ultiplication/**D**ivision, **A**ddition/**S**ubtraction.

Python follows
similar rules about which calculations to perform first. They're mostly pretty
intuitive.

```python
8 - 3 + 2
```

```python
-3 + 4 * 2
```

Sometimes the default order of operations isn't what we want:

```python
hat_height_cm = 25
my_height_cm = 190
# How tall am I, in meters, when wearing my hat?
total_height_meters = hat_height_cm + my_height_cm / 100
print("Height in meters =", total_height_meters, "?")
```

Parentheses are your trump card. You can add them to force Python to evaluate
sub-expressions in a different order (or just to make your code easier to read).

```python
total_height_meters = (hat_height_cm + my_height_cm) / 100
print("Height in meters =", total_height_meters)
```

### Builtin functions for working with numbers

`min` and `max` return the
minimum and maximum of their arguments, respectively...

```python
print(min(1, 2, 3))
print(max(1, 2, 3))
```

`abs` returns the absolute value of it argument:

```python
print(abs(32))
print(abs(-32))
```

In addition to being the names of Python's two main numerical types, `int` and
`float` can also be called as functions which convert their arguments to the
corresponding type:

```python
print(float(10))
print(int(3.33))
# They can even be called on strings!
print(int('807') + 1)
```
